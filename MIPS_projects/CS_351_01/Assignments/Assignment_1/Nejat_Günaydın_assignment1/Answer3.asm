#A list is defined here
.data
my_array: .word 10, 9, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 32
.text
la $s0, my_array    # based address of list loaded into $s0
addi $s1, $zero, 9  # $s1 is set to the size of the list 

# Now you have the size and the base address of the list
# You should implement sorting algorithms that provided to you in assignment guide
# After sorting the array you should be able to find the median of the list
# Continue to write your code here
